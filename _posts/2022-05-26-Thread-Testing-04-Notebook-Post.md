Today we will do a fourth round of thread tests on the controls.
Animals tested were T33, T34, T36, T37, T38 (only had 2 plaques), T39, and T40. I skipped over T35 because all of the plaques overlapped.
Data will be input in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GxLnNJjjjZ8xhBzz8nD-eUdpOwg6UY7yicG7ER5YIOQ/edit?usp=sharing) google sheet.
