Today we will do a second round of thread tests on the controls.
Animals tested were T14, T15, T16, T17, T19, and T23. Specimen T21 was skipped because the plastic kept ripping.
Data will be input in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GxLnNJjjjZ8xhBzz8nD-eUdpOwg6UY7yicG7ER5YIOQ/edit?usp=sharing) google sheet.
