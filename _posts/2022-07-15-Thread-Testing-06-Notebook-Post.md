Today we will do a sixth and final round of thread tests on the controls.
Animals tested were T55 (only had 2 threads), T56, T57, and T58 (only had 2 threads, the rest were overlapping).
Data will be input in [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GxLnNJjjjZ8xhBzz8nD-eUdpOwg6UY7yicG7ER5YIOQ/edit?usp=sharing) google sheet.
