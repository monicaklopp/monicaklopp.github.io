### Background
After comparing analyses and looking at genome feature locations, we decided to continue using the Ronit dataset with Yaamini controls to see what the processes look like.

### GOterm annotation
GOterm annotation was carried out using this [jupyter-notebook]()

The key outputs I got from this notebook are:
1. A master annotation table (cgigas_uk_roslin_v1_rna_from_genomic_annot.transcript.tab).
2. A summary (union, 1x coverage) of the CpG background generated form the .bed files, joined with transcript IDs and GO annotations (union_1x.GeneIDs.geneOverlap.transcriptIDs.GOAnnot).
3. A gene ID to GO term map that compares the unique transcript IDs within the background and the blast annotation (geneid2go.tab)
4. A summary object of the DML associated with the test factor, joined with transcript IDs and GO annotations (e.g., DML-Cov10-20.GeneIDs.geneOverlap.transcriptIDs.GOAnnot)  

I created a unique notebook for each dataset. Ronit's data had a lot of GO terms, and required at least 48 GB of ram to complete the analysis.

### Results

Here is the prior table for reference:
