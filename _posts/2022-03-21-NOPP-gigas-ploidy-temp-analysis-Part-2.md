### Background

We sent 72 samples for RNA sequencing (TagSeq) to the [Genomic Sequencing and Analysis Facility](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/GSAF/Home+Page) at the University of Texas at Austin. Here is a list of the samples:

The sample list, with RNA results, can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KY6P25HEmrDeszph56OY7tI1vAOd2rXxQ8wfZtCM7g0/edit?usp=sharing).

The zipped fastq files are available on gannet [here](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/panopea/NOPP-gigas-ploidy-temp/022022-tagseq)

Here is the [multiQC report](https://gsafjobs.icmb.utexas.edu/qc/JA21499/SA22026/multiqc/multiqc_report.html) that GSAF provided.

For analysis I will be leaning on notebook entries by [Laura](https://nbviewer.org/github/laurahspencer/O.lurida_QuantSeq-2020/blob/master/notebooks/2020-QuantSeq-Processing_Raw-to-Counts.ipynb) and [Ariana](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/EarlyLifeHistory_Energetics/blob/master/Mcap2020/Scripts/TagSeq/TagSeq_BioInf_genomeV2.md)
